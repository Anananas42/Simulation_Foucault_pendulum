# Simulation_Foucault_pendulum
See intuitively on a large scale how Foucault's pendulum proves the rotation of the Earth around its axis.

## How to run
Start the Unity application using "Foucault Pendulum.exe"

- Left click + drag to rotate the Earth
- Right click to place a pendulum
- 'M' to switch between free view and locked view from above of the pendulum

The closer the pendulum is placed to either South or North pole, the more it shows Earth's rotation. Imagine if you were standing right next to it. Relative to you, standing on the rotating Earth, the pendulum would seem to be rotating all by itself! Earth's rotation is the most plausible explanation for this observation.
